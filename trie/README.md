# Simple Spell Checker

This project implements a basic spell checker using a Trie data structure. It can identify misspelled words in a given sentence by checking them against a dictionary built from a text corpus.

## Features

- **Trie-based Dictionary**: Efficient storage and lookup of words using a Trie.
- **Spell Checking Functionality**: Identifies words not present in the pre-loaded dictionary.

## Prerequisites

Before running the spell checker, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `nltk` library

You can install `nltk` using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

## How to Run
To execute the spell checker, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
python spell_checker.py
```
